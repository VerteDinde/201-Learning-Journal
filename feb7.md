# LJ Code 201 - Day 1 (Feb 7)

Today, I:

- Learned about control flow (principally “if-else” statements)
- Used "code ." in the terminal to open an entire folder into Visual Code Editor
- Learned the difference between "border" and "outline" within CSS
- Built "About Me" guessing game and uploaded the repo
- Learned how to use getElementById to pull the user answers into the HTML page
- Played around with CSS elements such as background-image and borders

It was a good, intense day. I felt as though I learned a lot and am really enjoying my classmates. This is a great group.
