# LJ Code 201 - Day 4 (Feb 9)

Today, I:

- Pair programmed! Did a pair programming lab with Grayson and Amy, and got to work with another person's code.
- Learned about functions, and the more intricate oddity of local and global variables. Seeing how easy it could be to accidentially redefine a global function within local scope was a little scary, but really good to know.
- Volunteered to show off my code in code review. I was pretty proud of my current website and the JS code I had crafted for the about me game, and so I was happy to have itLe in front of the class.
- Learned how to collaborate by forking repos and submitting pull requests to other repos. Learning how to clone, branch and push up on a remote branch was handy and I'm feeling more confident about it.
- Learned that a prompt always produces a string, which seems obvious, but just wasn't something that I had ever thought critically about. When you see a number, you assume number. It's good to know that for debugging.
- Played with NaN. What a strange value. NaN is Not A Number. NaN = NaN is false, but it is a type number. The reason it appears here is when you try to turn a string into a number, and Javascript can’t recognize it - Number(‘slug’). So how do you detect it? isNaN( ). isNaN(parseInt(‘slug’)) = true.
- Learned that I can move full lines of code with Alt + Up or Down. You can do one line or full highlighted blocks of code.

Today was much less challenging than yesterday. I'm glad I booked the time to pair with Amy, as she was very helpful. I'm going to book more time with her for next week. I was also glad for a bit of breather day to focus on git (which I needed practice on) and review my code, rather than charging straight forward.
