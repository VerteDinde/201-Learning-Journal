# LJ Code 201 - Day 6 (Feb 13)

Today, I:

- Learned about the DOM (Document Object Model). I had read up on this over the weekend, and just started to wrap my head around it, but it wa very good to go over it in class. 
- Learned about the problem domain and mocking up specs and solutions to real world problems, based on what a client wants. 
- Reviewed functions and objects, and put properties and methods inside the objetc literal
- Taught myself to use 'push' to push values into a new array as a method iterated through an existing array.
- Summed the total value of that new array and pushed it into the DOM as a piece of textContent.
- Majorly fumbled through a lot of CSS. I can bullsh*t my way through basic design, but when it comes to actually technically laying out sites well using CSS, I'm still very much a rookie. I may need to do an additional Treehouse CSS class or Codeacademy class on design while I'm in 201 to make up for my poor design/CSS skills. Or maybe I'm right in the average for the class? I honestly can't tell where I stand there.
- Did some very frustrating, but valuable debugging inside my objects and methods because my method kept returning NaN. Ultimately, it was always because of a stupid syntax error (forgetting the () for a function call, or dropping a letter in a variable), but it was good to learn the debugging practices of setting console.logs at the inputs and outputs.
- Tried to be better about running my code in small steps, rather than writing a large chunk of code and then running it.

Reflections on today: Today was a challenging day, and I felt a little more blurry than I did last week, likely as the difficulty starts to set in. I need to be cautious to always eat breakfast, a good lunch and take frequent walks as we continue on so I don't burn myself out. Looking forward to tomorrow.
