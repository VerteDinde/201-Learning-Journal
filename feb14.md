# LJ Code 201 - Day 7 (Feb 14)

Today, I:

- Learned about constructors, and using constructors to create multiple objects with the same properties and methods.
- Built a table entirely through pushing Javascript to the DOM. It was good practice to move through the DOM step by step; I was incredibly frustrated trying to figure out how to structure the problem, but it was helpful to talk it out with someone else.
- Went into deeper detail into building a table using theader, tbody and tfooter.
- Had additional practice writing functions and practicing the syntax for functions and methods. The syntax is slightly different, so it was good to have to write them.
- Added additional CSS formatting to the salmon cookies page; it still needs a lot of love, but the table formatting looks better.
- Had a Voodoo Donut! Yum!

Reflections on today: This has been a very challenging week so far, as promised. I was probably more frustrated this afternoon than I have been throughout the entire class - although the class is moving so fast and is so loaded, I honestly forget half the time that we're only on the second day of Week 2. The feeling of satisfaction after solving the table problem was fantastic. Can't wait for tomorrow.
