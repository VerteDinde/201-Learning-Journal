# LJ Code 201 - Day 3 (Feb 8)

Today, I:

- Made my first ever pull request; I learned how to create a local branch, use "checkout" to switch branches and merge the commits with master.
- I also learned how to pull down the new updated master branch back to my local directory - git pull origin master.
- Arrays: I successfully wrote a for loop that parsed through an array, and wrote a second for loop to give feedback to the user. The first foor loop was nested inside of the second one.
- Arrays are zero-indexed and can store multiple data types.
- Learned the box structure in CSS, which prioritizes Content -> Padding -> Border -> Margin
- margin: 0, 0, 0, 0 -> top, right, bottom, left
- margin: 20px 0px;
- I haven't learned how to do breakpoints for responsive design, but am going to research that as well - I think that would be an important thing to know.

Today was the most challenging day so far; I had a difficult time with the last two questions. Learning to debug was important, though, and I'm very happy with the site and the quiz so far.
