# LJ Code 201 - Day 5 (Feb 10)

Today, I:

- Learned more about the difference between block elements, inline elements and inline blocks. CSS is crazy. 
- Learned about floats, period. I had heard about floats, but never really understood what they were or when you would use one. It was interesting to see how they interacted with their parent containers, and how you can use additional content to anchor them down. I also found the .clearfix() element interesting - you can bring in additional content, or just clear float values on the next child.
- Took a much deeper dive into functions and how to work with them. I've always done functions on a surface level, but this is really the first time - ever - that I've explored them in this level of depth. Key points I want to remember:
-   * You have a comma-separated list of arguments, which are all passing into the function.
    * You can pass in as many arguments as you want. Too many, theyâ€™re ignored. Too few, they will be undefined.
    * If you put an expression into an argument, that whole expression will evaluate (e.g sum (2, 4) ).
- Did actual problem solving coding in functions to solve problems. That was great; this was my favorite lab yet.
- Successfully parsed through an array to pull values and add and multiply them.
- Unsuccessfully iterated and added the values in an array - well, I was successful, but couldn't figure out the for loop and the sum() combined. I'd like to solve that problem.
- Practiced branching, pushing and merging within a repo. Each function in my JS file was completed, pushed and merged on a different branch. It was great practice.

Reflections on this week in general: This was a good first week. It was a pleasant combination of challenging and relaxing - I think I might even like to move a little faster than we are right now! I'd like to do more problem solving within functions and code, and maybe a bit less design (although I know that's important! I just have more experience there, so that's selfishly speaking. :) ). 

I'm very glad I made the decision to take this class and try my hand at becoming a developer. Looking forward to more challenges and problems to come. Bring on Week 2 - let's do this.
